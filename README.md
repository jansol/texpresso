A pure Rust texture compression suite

This library started out as `squish-rs`, a pure rust port of Simon Brown's libsquish but was forked and renamed to avoid confusion as the API and format support is expanded beyond the original C++ library.

# Crates in This Workspace
* lib: `texpresso` - The library itself
* cli: `texpresso_cli` - A command-line utility for compressing and decompressing textures, also serves as a usage example for the library. Note that the actual executable is also called 'texpresso'.

# Roadmap

### Library

S3 Texture Compression formats
* [x] DXT1 aka BC1: 8bpc RGB with optional binary alpha
* [x] DXT3 aka BC2: 8bpc RGB with paletted alpha
* [x] DXT5 aka BC3: 8bpc RGB with interpolated alpha

3Dc variants / RGTC (Red-Green Texture Compression)
* [x] ATI1 aka RGTC1 aka BC4: 8-bit grayscale
* [x] ATI2 aka RGTC2 aka BC5: two 8-bit channels

Direct3D 11 additions / BPTC (Block-Partition Texture Compression?)
* [ ] BPTC\_ALPHA aka BC6h: 16-bit HDR RGB
* [ ] BPTC aka BC7: 8-bit RGB with optional alpha

Ericsson Texture Compression (common in mobile chips)
* [ ] R11\_EAC: 11-bit grayscale
* [ ] RG11\_EAC: two 11-bit channels
* [ ] ETC2: 8bpc RGB
* [ ] ETC2\_EAC: 8bpc RGB + 11-bit alpha
* [ ] PUNCHTHROUGH\_ALPHA1\_ETC2: 8bpc RGB with punchthrough alpha

Adaptable Scalable Texture Compression (common in modern mobile chips)
* the texture compression format to end all texture compression formats
* needs further investigating due to vast complexity and e.g. supporting non-square blocks
* [ ] ASTC\_LDR
* [ ] ASTC\_HDR

Compatibility / ease of use
* [x] no\_std
* [ ] support compiling for GPU targets via [rust-gpu](https://shader.rs/)
* [ ] Support 1-4 input channels without requiring padding in the calling code

### CLI

non-texture formats
* [x] Read PNG
* [x] Read JPG
* [x] Write PNG

Containers for compressed textures
* [x] Read DDS
* [x] Write DDS
* [ ] Read KTX
* [ ] Write KTX
* [ ] Read KTX2
* [ ] Write KTX2

Target platforms
* [ ] Support encoding on GPU via Vulkan

Maintenance
* [x] Migrate to clap 4
